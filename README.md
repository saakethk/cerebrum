# cerebrum
A python library designed to make getting years of stock data and caching it locally in duckdb format efficient. Abstracts away duckdb functions and such to make it so that people can focus on creating models rather than dealing with data.

# Current Implementation
- The database class is implemented via DuckDB.
- The source class is currently implemented via openbb.
